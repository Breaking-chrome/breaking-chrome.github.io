## Write Protection
If you want to remove ChromeOS and get another os, e.g. GalliumOS, or just change boot orders, remove chrome bitmaps or install the UEFI boot loader, then you must have the write protection screw or jumper taken out. For different models there are different instructions, so search up "(Type your model - It can be found at the bottom of the chromebook) write protect screw" in google and you might be able to find what you're looking for.

For this tutorial though, we are using the Asus c201 chromebook.
