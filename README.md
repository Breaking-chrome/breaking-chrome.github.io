# README... Or don't. This is just for if you want to contribute.
This repository isn't really for adding to, but if you want to correct an error and/or make another whole page, then you can. There are still so many rabbit holes from this topic.
Firstly: Everything must be a .md file. That's the rules.
Secondly: Any changes I will make from the community will only be from [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-w7gjkeJlZGAbf8VknGb_VeG-jTiJ6QXi39bR-3CmoI/edit?usp=sharing). Also the repository I will check maybe... Every fortnight?
