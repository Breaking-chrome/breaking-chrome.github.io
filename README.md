# README... Or don't. This is just for if you want to contribute.
This repository isn't really for adding to, but if you want to correct an error and/or make another whole page, then you can. There are still so many rabbit holes from this topic.

Firstly: Everything must be a .md file. That's the rules.

Secondly: Any changes I will make from the community will only be from (Doc will be here tonight). Also the repository I will check maybe... Every fortnight?
