# Breaking the Boundaries of ChromeOS 
### _Making the most of your chromebook_
Chromebooks are not really a competetor in the magical race of "Productivity", "Is this cool-looking" and "Does this have Steam I want Crab Game". Well, your search is now finished because you found this!

Chromebooks are good devices to test out things, because they offer the [Chromebook recovery utility](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm?hl=en) extension, which all you need for that is a broken chromebook and a USB. You can also use non-write-protect options like Crouton and Crostini. Other options require the write-protect screw or jumper to be taken out, as they need access to the SeaBIOS (Chromebook BIOS)
