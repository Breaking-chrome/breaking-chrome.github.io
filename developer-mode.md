## Developer Mode
Developer mode is required for all hacks that change the UI (User interface), OS (Operating system) and even the BIOS (Basic Input/output system, aka code stuff) which requires some extra steps. To enable dev mode, you need to press `escape + refresh + power` or `maximise + power`. At the "Chrome OS is missing or damaged" screen press `ctrl + D` then enter, then `ctrl + D` again. Congrats! You are in developer mode. You just will need to sign in, and voila! You can use everything with the “◉” symbol mentioned on this site.

To enter the developer console, press `ctrl + shift + F2` (--> button at the top), and to exit, press `ctrl + shift + F1` (<-- button at the top). Login as `chronos` and back in chrome, go to `ctrl + alt + T` to open a shell. Now type in `shell` and hit enter. Now we have a full ChromeOS developer shell inside the browser!
